Bukvarko helps you teach kids numbers 1-100 with synthetic speech.

My son learned the alphabet with a game (https://mristin.github.io/bukvarko), so I decided
to make another game for him to learn the numbers as well. You hear a number and need to
write it down. There is a puzzle of a duck and each correct answer paints one part of the
puzzle.

The game supports the following languages:
Bosnian (bs), 
German (de), 
English (en), 
Spanish (es), 
French (fr), 
Croatian (hr),
Dutch (nl) and 
Serbian (sr).

Live demo

Educational advice
------------------
Don't force your kid to learn numbers if s/he does not show
proper interest. It will just kill the motivation.

Help your kid with the game. It is intended as a group activity
for both the parent and the child.

I vectorized the photo of the puzzle. We bought the puzzle 
at a garage sale. Unfortunately, I could not find the origin of the image.
